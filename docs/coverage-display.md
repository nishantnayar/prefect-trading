- **File-Level Details**: Individual file coverage with missing line information
- **Insights & Recommendations**: AI-powered analysis and improvement suggestions

## Key Features

### 1. Unified Data Format
- **Normalized Coverage Data**: Consistent JSON structure regardless of source
- **Path Normalization**: Cross-platform file path handling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when data is missing or malformed

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Visualization

    "src/ui/components/testing_results.py": {
      "executed_lines": [1, 2, 3, ...],
      "summary": {
        "covered_lines": 598,

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- **Missing Coverage Data**: Shows warning message
- **Malformed JSON**: Displays error with details
- **Empty Results**: Provides helpful instructions
- **Partial Data**: Shows available information

### Debug Information
- **File Loading**: Logs file paths and loading status
- **Parsing Errors**: Shows specific error messages
- **Data Validation**: Checks for required fields
- **Fallback Options**: Alternative data sources

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Run Tests Regularly**: Use `python scripts/run_tests.py` to generate fresh coverage data
2. **Check Coverage Levels**: Aim for â‰¥80% coverage on critical modules
3. **Review Insights**: Pay attention to automated recommendations
4. **Focus on Missing Lines**: Prioritize files with specific missing line numbers

### For Maintainers
1. **Monitor Trends**: Track coverage changes over time
2. **Set Standards**: Define minimum coverage requirements
3. **Review Distribution**: Ensure balanced coverage across modules
4. **Update Recommendations**: Refine insight algorithms based on project needs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Coverage Data
- **Cause**: Tests not run or coverage not generated
- **Solution**: Run `python scripts/run_tests.py`

#### Coverage Mismatch
- **Cause**: Different coverage tools or configurations
- **Solution**: Use unified test runner with consistent settings

#### UI Not Updating
- **Cause**: Cached data or file permissions
- **Solution**: Refresh page and check file permissions

#### Missing Files
- **Cause**: Files excluded from coverage or not in src/ directory
- **Solution**: Check coverage configuration and file paths

### Debug Steps
1. Check if `build/coverage.json` exists and is readable
2. Verify test execution completed successfully
3. Review console logs for parsing errors
4. Validate JSON structure manually if needed

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Historical Tracking**: Coverage trends over time
- **Custom Thresholds**: Configurable coverage level boundaries
- **Export Options**: PDF/CSV reports
- **Integration**: CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Notifications**: Coverage drop alerts

### Potential Improvements
- **Branch Coverage**: Support for branch coverage metrics
- **Function Coverage**: Detailed function-level analysis
- **Test Impact**: Identify which tests affect which lines
- **Coverage Maps**: Visual file coverage highlighting

## Conclusion

The holistic coverage display system provides a comprehensive, user-friendly way to understand and improve code coverage. By addressing CLI/UI mismatches and providing multiple visualization layers, it enables developers to make informed decisions about testing priorities and track progress toward coverage goals.
