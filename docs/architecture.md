# System Architecture

## Overview

The Prefect Trading System is designed as a modular, event-driven architecture that handles market data collection, processing, and analysis. The system is built using Prefect for workflow orchestration and follows a microservices-like pattern for different components.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Collection Layer
- **Yahoo Finance Integration**
  - Handles historical and real-time market data from Yahoo Finance
  - Implements rate limiting and error handling
  - Supports batch and streaming data collection

- **Alpaca Integration**
  - Manages real-time market data through Alpaca's API
  - Handles WebSocket connections for live data
  - Implements daily data collection routines

- **News API Integration**
  - Fetches market news and headlines
  - Implements caching and rate limiting
  - Stores articles in PostgreSQL database

### 2. Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL Integration**
  - Manages database connections and connection pooling
  - Implements data persistence strategies
  - Handles schema management and migrations
  - Stores market data, news articles, and portfolio information

### 3. Processing Layer
- **Hourly Processing**
  - Real-time data processing and analysis
  - Market condition monitoring
  - Alert generation

- **End-of-Day Processing**
  - Daily data aggregation
  - Symbol maintenance
  - Historical data updates

### 4. UI Layer
- **Streamlit Dashboard**
  - Real-time market data visualization
  - Portfolio management interface
  - News feed integration
  - Market status monitoring
  - Compact and efficient layouts
  - Responsive design with expandable sections

### 5. Workflow Management
- **Prefect Orchestration**
  - Flow scheduling and execution
  - Task dependency management
  - Error handling and retry logic

## Data Flow

1. **Real-time Data Flow**
   ```
   Market Data Sources → WebSocket Connection → Data Processing → Database
   ```

2. **Batch Processing Flow**
   ```
   Data Sources → Batch Collection → Data Processing → Database → Analysis
   ```

3. **News Processing Flow**
   ```
   News API → Article Collection → Database Storage → UI Display
   ```

4. **UI Data Flow**
   ```
   Database → Data Processing → UI Components → User Interface
   ```

## Error Handling

The system implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Circuit breakers for external service failures
- Logging and monitoring for system health
- Alert generation for critical failures
- Graceful degradation of UI components

## Security

- API key management through Prefect secrets
- Database credential security
- Rate limiting implementation
- Access control and authentication
- Secure storage of sensitive data

## Scalability

The system is designed to scale horizontally:
- Independent processing of different data sources
- Parallel execution of workflows
- Resource optimization through Prefect's task scheduling
- Efficient database querying and caching
- Optimized UI rendering and data loading
