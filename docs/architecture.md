# System Architecture

## Overview

The Prefect Trading System is designed as a modular, event-driven architecture that handles market data collection, processing, and analysis. The system is built using Prefect for workflow orchestration and includes a modern Streamlit-based user interface for real-time monitoring and interaction.

## Core Components

  - Handles historical and real-time market data from Yahoo Finance
  - Implements rate limiting and error handling with exponential backoff
  - Supports batch and streaming data collection
  - Collects comprehensive company information and officer data

- **Alpaca Integration**
  - Manages real-time market data through Alpaca's API
  - Handles WebSocket connections for live data streaming
  - Implements daily data collection routines
  - Supports both paper and live trading environments

- **News API Integration**
  - Fetches market news and headlines from NewsAPI
  - Implements caching and rate limiting
  - Stores articles in PostgreSQL database with full metadata
  - Supports multiple categories and languages

### 2. Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL Integration**
  - Manages database connections and connection pooling
  - Implements data persistence strategies with upsert operations
  - Handles schema management and migrations
  - Stores market data, news articles, company information, and portfolio data
  - Includes comprehensive indexing for optimal query performance

### 3. Processing Layer
- **Hourly Processing**
  - Real-time data processing and analysis
  - Market condition monitoring
  - Alert generation and notification

- **End-of-Day Processing**
  - Daily data aggregation and cleanup
  - Symbol maintenance and delisting checks
  - Historical data updates and validation
  - Company information refresh

### 4. UI Layer

  - Real-time market data visualization with auto-refresh
  - Portfolio management interface with expandable sections
  - News feed integration with article previews
  - Market status monitoring with timezone support
  - Symbol selector with search functionality
  - Responsive design optimized for different screen sizes
  - Custom CSS styling for professional appearance

### 5. Workflow Management
- **Prefect Orchestration**
  - Flow scheduling and execution with cron-based triggers
  - Task dependency management and error handling
  - Retry logic and circuit breakers
  - Comprehensive logging and monitoring
  - Secret management for API credentials

## Data Flow

1. **Real-time Data Flow**
   ```
   Market Data Sources → WebSocket Connection → Data Processing → Database → UI Display
   ```

2. **Batch Processing Flow**
   ```
   Data Sources → Batch Collection → Data Processing → Database → Analysis → UI Updates
   ```

3. **News Processing Flow**
   ```
   News API → Article Collection → Database Storage → UI Display → User Interaction
   ```

4. **UI Data Flow**
   ```
   Database → Data Processing → UI Components → User Interface → User Actions → Database Updates
   ```

## System Workflows

### 1. Hourly Process Flow
- **Schedule**: Every hour from 9AM-3PM EST on weekdays
- **Purpose**: Real-time market data collection and processing
- **Components**: Database connectivity, data validation, storage

### 2. End-of-Day Process Flow
- **Schedule**: 6PM EST on weekdays
- **Purpose**: Daily data aggregation and maintenance
- **Components**: Symbol maintenance, Yahoo Finance data collection, cleanup

### 3. Market Data WebSocket Flow
- **Schedule**: 9:30AM EST on weekdays
- **Purpose**: Real-time market data streaming
- **Components**: WebSocket connection, real-time processing, database storage

## Error Handling

The system implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Protection against external service failures
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging with loguru
- **Alert Generation**: Critical failure notifications
- **Graceful Degradation**: UI components handle data unavailability
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and validation

## Security

- **API Key Management**: Secure storage using Prefect secrets
- **Database Security**: Credential encryption and connection pooling
- **Rate Limiting**: Implementation across all external APIs
- **Access Control**: Environment-based configuration
- **Secure Storage**: No hardcoded credentials in source code

## Scalability

The system is designed to scale horizontally:
- **Independent Processing**: Different data sources processed separately
- **Parallel Execution**: Workflows can run concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Prefect's task scheduling and resource management
- **Efficient Database**: Optimized queries, indexing, and caching
- **UI Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient component rendering
